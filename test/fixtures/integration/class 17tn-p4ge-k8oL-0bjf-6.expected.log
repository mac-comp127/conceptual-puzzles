Translate the specification below into an idiomatic Java class definition.

(In this context, "idiomatic" means following the common style and conventions
of the language.)

 1. One kind of thing that exists in our model is a [4mStaice[24m.
    
 2. Each [4mStaice[24m has its own [4mfeatu[24m, which is a string. The value of [4mfeatu[24m is
    specified when a [4mStaice[24m is created. Anyone can ask a [4mStaice[24m for the value of
    its [4mfeatu[24m. The value of [4mfeatu[24m for a specific [4mStaice[24m can never change.
    
 3. Each [4mStaice[24m has a [4meersa[24m, which is a list of strings. An [4meersa[24m is part of the
    internal state of a [4mStaice[24m: no other classes can see the value of [4meersa[24m or
    directly change it. When a [4mStaice[24m is first created, the value of its [4meersa[24m
    starts out as an empty mutable list.
    
 4. All [4mStaice[24ms share a single [4mTHIOCMI[24m, which is a string. It is a constant. Its
    value is "um". Other classes [1mcan[22m see its value.
    
 5. A [4mStaice[24m can [4mhesmate[24m. This behavior adds "rialsoss" to [4meersa[24m. Anyone can ask
    a [4mStaice[24m to [4mhesmate[24m.
    
 6. Each [4mStaice[24m has a [4minLunre[24m, which is an int. The value of [4minLunre[24m is not part
    of a [4mStaice[24m’s internal state; instead, it is computed on demand. The
    computed value of [4minLunre[24m is the length of [4mfeatu[24m.

 1. One kind of thing that exists in our model is an [4mAndfo[24m.

    its [4mesEmed[24m. The value of [4mesEmed[24m for a specific [4mBecges[24m can never change.
    
 3. All [4mBecges[24ms share a single [4mteo[24m, which is an int. No other classes can
    directly ask for the value of [4mteo[24m. The value of [4mteo[24m starts out as 7 when the
    program starts. Every time a new [4mBecges[24m is created, it adds 8 to [4mteo[24m.
    
 4. All [4mBecges[24ms share a single [4mSQAN_MOV[24m, which is a graphics object. It is a
    constant. Its value is a rectangle with a width of 13 and a height of 33.
    Other classes [1mcan[22m see its value.
    
 5. Each [4mBecges[24m has a [4mvul[24m, which is an int. The value of [4mvul[24m is not part of a
    [4mBecges[24m’s internal state; instead, it is computed on demand. The computed
    value of [4mvul[24m is the width of [4mSQAN_MOV[24m.
    
 6. A [4mBecges[24m can [4mermify[24m. This behavior adds 8 to [4mteo[24m. Anyone can ask a [4mBecges[24m to
    [4mermify[24m.

Things to check in your solution:

  - Is every [4mpublic[24m and [4mprivate[24m modifier correct?
  - Are the correct items [4mstatic[24m?
  - Are the correct items [4mfinal[24m?
  - Are all the variable types and method return types correct?
  - Are the class members in the correct order? It should be: (1) static
    variables, (2) instance variables, (3) constructors, (4) methods.
  - Do members have the correct capitalization?

Acceptable variations in the solution:

  - It is OK if you initialized [1mnon-static[22m variables" in the constructor instead
    of in the declaration. (Ask your instructor if you aren’t clear what this
    means.) Note that [1mstatic[22m variables [3mmust[23m be initialized in the declaration.
  - It is OK if you used a slightly different but equivalent form of an
    expression, such as [4m+= 1[24m instead of [4m++[24m.
