 1. One kind of thing that exists in our model is a [4mStaice[24m.
    
 2. Each [4mStaice[24m has its own [4mfeatu[24m, which is a string. The value of [4mfeatu[24m is
    specified when a [4mStaice[24m is created. Anyone can ask a [4mStaice[24m for the value of
    its [4mfeatu[24m. The value of [4mfeatu[24m for a specific [4mStaice[24m can never change.
    
 3. Each [4mStaice[24m has a [4meersa[24m, which is a list of strings. An [4meersa[24m is part of the
    internal state of a [4mStaice[24m: no other classes can see the value of [4meersa[24m or
    directly change it. When a [4mStaice[24m is first created, the value of its [4meersa[24m
    starts out as an empty mutable list.
    
 4. All [4mStaice[24ms share a single [4mTHIOCMI[24m, which is a string. It is a constant. Its
    value is "um". Other classes [1mcan[22m see its value.
    
 5. A [4mStaice[24m can [4mhesmate[24m. This behavior adds "rialsoss" to [4meersa[24m. Anyone can ask

Things to check in your solution:

  - Is every [4mpublic[24m and [4mprivate[24m modifier correct?
  - Are the correct items [4mstatic[24m?
  - Are the correct items [4mfinal[24m?
  - Are all the variable types and method return types correct?
  - Are the class members in the correct order? It should be: (1) static
    variables, (2) instance variables, (3) constructors, (4) methods.
  - Do members have the correct capitalization?

Acceptable variations in the solution:

  - It is OK if you initialized [1mnon-static[22m variables" in the constructor instead
    of in the declaration. (Ask your instructor if you aren’t clear what this
    means.) Note that [1mstatic[22m variables [3mmust[23m be initialized in the declaration.
  - It is OK if you used a slightly different but equivalent form of an
    expression, such as [4m+= 1[24m instead of [4m++[24m.
