Explanation (which you do [3mnot[23m need to write out in your submitted solution):

 1. [4mo[24m is a static variable, [4mdrid[24m is an instance variable, and [4mgict[24m is a local
    variable.
    
 2. At [100m[97m  J  [39m[49m , [4mx0[24m and [4mx1[24m are out of scope because they are not declared yet.
    [4mdrid[24m is out of scope because it is an [3minstance[23m variable, but [4mmain[24m is a
    [3mstatic[23m method. [4mgict[24m is out of scope because it is local to [4mgelec[24m.
    
 3. At [100m[97m  K  [39m[49m , [4mdrid[24m is out of scope because it is an [3minstance[23m variable, but [4mmain[24m
