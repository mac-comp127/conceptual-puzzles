# Comp 127 Conceptual Mastery Puzzles

To try some puzzles:

- Clone this project locally.
- Open a terminal in the project directory. There are several ways to do this; pick any one of them:
    - Open the project in Visual Studio Code, then from the menu bar, choose Terminal → New Terminal.
    - On macOS, open the app named “Terminal.” Then drag the project folder (named `conceptual-puzzles`) onto Terminal’s icon in the Dock.
    - On Windows, find the `conceptual-puzzles` folder in File Explorer. Then right-click on it, choose “Show more options,” then choose “Open in Terminal.”

Once you have a terminal open:

- Type `bin/puzzle` and press return / enter for basic usage instructions.
    - On Windows, you may have to type `bin\puzzle` instead (note the backslash `\` instead of slash `/`), depending on which type of command line you are using. (Windows has two; it’s confusing!)
- Type `bin/puzzle list` to see the different types of puzzles you can attempt.
- Type `bin/puzzle --help` to see all the available options.

From there, get your puzzle hat on and follow the instructions in the terminal!
