# Comp 127 Conceptual Mastery Puzzles

To try some puzzles:

- Clone this project locally.
- Open a terminal in the project directory. There are several ways to do this:
    - Open the project in VS Code, then from the menu bar, choose Terminal → New Terminal.
    - On macOS, open the app named “Terminal.” Then drag the project folder onto Terminal’s icon in the Dock.
    - On Windows.....**insert instructions for opening a command prompt from Explorer here**

Once you have a terminal open:

- Type `bin/puzzle` (or possibly `bin\puzzle` on Windows, depending on which command prompt you are using) and press return/enter for basic usage instructions.
- Type `bin/puzzle list` to see the different types of puzzles you can attempt.
- Type `bin/puzzle --help` to see all the available options.

From there, get your puzzle hat on and follow the instructions in the terminal!
